When you use `await` with a Promise, it pauses the execution of the asynchronous function until the Promise is settled (either fulfilled with a value or rejected with a reason). If the Promise is not fulfilled (i.e., it is still pending), the execution will be paused until the Promise is resolved or rejected.

In such a scenario, the code after the `await` line will not be immediately executed. Instead, it will wait until the Promise is settled, and then the function will continue its execution based on the result of the Promise.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

```javascript
async function exampleAsyncFunction() {
  console.log('Start');

  // Assume somePromise is an unresolved Promise
  try {
    const result = await somePromise;
    console.log('This line will not be executed if the Promise is unresolved');
    console.log('Result:', result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('An error occurred:', error);
  }

  console.log('End');
}

exampleAsyncFunction();
```

In this example, if `somePromise` is still pending when the `await` line is encountered, the execution will be paused until the Promise is settled. The lines following the `await` will only be executed after the Promise is resolved or rejected. If the Promise is rejected, the control will jump to the `catch` block. If it's resolved, the control will continue with the next lines after the `await`.

Keep in mind that using `await` without a `try-catch` block will result in an unhandled Promise rejection, which could lead to an unhandled promise rejection warning in some environments. It's generally good practice to handle errors with a `try-catch` block when using `await`.
