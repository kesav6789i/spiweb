    // 1. In JS, before the code is executed, the variables get initialized to undefined.
// 2. Arrow functions enact as variables and get "undefined" during the memory creation phase while functions actually get run.
// 3. *** Hoisting ***: Mechanism in JS where the variable declarations are moved to the top of the scope before execution. Therefore it is possible to call a function before initializing it.
// 4. Whenever a JS program is run, a global execution block is created, which comprises of 2: Memory creation and Code execution.
// 5. Variable declarations are scanned and are made undefined
// 6. Function declarations are scanned and are made available
// 7. var is initialized with undefined but let is not initialized to undefined
// 8. et variables are not initialized until their definition is evaluated. Accessing them before the initialization results in ReferenceError.
// 9.JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.
