****Position****


The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document.
position : static / relative / absolute / fixed
Position
static - default position (The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect)
relative - element is relative to itself. (The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index will work)
absolute - positioned relative to its clo sest positioned ancestor. (removed from the flow)
fixed - positioned relative to browser. (removed from flow)

******z-index*****


It decides the stack level of elements
z-index : auto (0)
z-index : 1 / 2 / ...
z-index : -1 / -2 / ...

read it to understand better :)

1.generally z-index is zero...but in first and second ...the second has highest z value than the first until u set the z-index for it....
2.the more the z-index the more its value
3.if position is static then z-value cannot be set
