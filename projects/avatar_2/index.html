        "Avatar: The Way of Water" begins to tell the story of the Sully family (Jake, Neytiri, and their kids), the trouble that follows them, the lengths they go to keep each other safe, the battles they fight to stay alive, and the tragedies they endure.

            <div class="one"><h3>Jake Sully (Sam Worthington)</h3>
            <p>Sam Worthington reprises his role of disabled ex-marine turned forest-dwelling Na’vi Jake Sully, only this time as a father of four — two sons and two daughters.</p></div>
            <div>
            <h3>Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña)</h3>
            <p>Neytiri is the Na’vi love of Jake’s life. The story of their relationship can be found in the first “Avatar” film, in which Neytiri fell in love with Jake despite him being an outsider. Neytiri feels torn between her people and her love, but since she has started a new family, she ultimately devotes her energy to them and Jake.</p>

            <h3>Kiri (Sigourney Weaver)</h3>
            <p>Kiri’s conception inside the Avatar body of the late scientist and researcher Grace (Sigourney Weaver) remains a mystery, but the young daughter of the lover of the Na’vi people carries on a lot of Grace’s characteristics, like her fascination with the creatures of Pandora and how the whole system of the planet connects.</p></div>
            <div>
            <h3>Quaritch (Stephen Lang)</h3>
            <p>Stephen Lang returns to Pandora in a reincarnation of sorts of his character from the first film: Colonel Miles Quaritch. Though Jake killed Quaritch’s human form and body on Pandora in “Avatar” (2009), scientists had prepared for such an event by storing his memories and essence on a backup hard drive to use for an Avatar body they inserted him into on Earth</p>
